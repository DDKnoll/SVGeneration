To start a new graphic clone one of the existing graphics to a new folder e.g. `cp ./recipes/Diagonal-Stripes/ ./recipes/New-Graphic`.

The graphic needs a config.json and a script.js, which specifies the parameters needed to customize and render the graphic.  The script.js can be written in es6 and its only requirement is a generate function which returns a valid svg.

Once you've customized your graphic, push it to a repo on your github account and submit a pull request to my repository.
